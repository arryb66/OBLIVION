.arryb on discord, discord image IP logger, made and coded by .arryb.

Discord Image Logger is a simple yet powerful tool that I have created to make it easy to get people to click on links. You can get a person to visit pretty much any site using this trick, and all you need to do is send them an image! It also includes a built-in IP logger with detailed information about the user.

Please note that this is NOT a "one click" image logger. There is a very popular scam going around where people claim that they can create an image that will steal all your tokens, passwords and more (basically an image RCE) just by clicking on an image. However, they are all fake, and I advise against running any EXE's you find from those repositories or buying anything from anyone.

For it to work, at the start the image. when sent will NOT load ON PURPOSE. tell them to open it on a search engine then it will log all theyre info and sent it too your webhook. 

You will need to change two lines of code, changing the webhook and the picture it will show them when opened.
for "name your file, make sure you do /api then /tenor or any website with gifs.
